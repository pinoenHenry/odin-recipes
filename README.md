# odin-recipes
A simple page with links to recipes.
By doing this first project, my goal is to put in practica what I have been learning so far through The Odin Project curriculum.
Until now I have learnt:
What HTML is and how to use it as a structure for our projects. 
HTML's main tag elements, such as <html>, <head>, <title>, <link>, <body>, <h1> to <h6>, <p>, <a>,
<img> among others. 
Use of tag's attributes such as href, alt, src.
How to make relative and absolute path when working with links and images. 
What are the main forms of images formats availables and its characteristics in each case.
